### Learning Goals:

(What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals of this project is to build Tik Tak Toe from scractch. The primary learning goals were mastering fundamental web development skills, including HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. I focused on developing proficiency in JavaScript, particularly in DOM manipulation and game logic implementation. The project also emphasized learning responsive design and CSS animations to enhance user experience, as well as providing experience in writing organized and maintainable code, essential for effective web development.

  

### Wins + Challenges:

(What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

A lesson I learned from the last project was to base my changes on a single source of truth. I made an effort to have all the dynamic elements in the game be based off the data model. The second win was the Draw condition. The problem i faced was that the game was calling the win and draw condition at the same time. I fixed it by adding a 1ms delay to the draw condition to make sure they're checked one at a time.
